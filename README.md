Getting Started
---------------

Installing SharpGL is easy, just use Nuget:

````
PM> Install-Package SharpGLCore
````

The Core is simply the full set of OpenGL functions and extensions wrapped and available to use.

````
PM> Install-Package SharpGLforWinForms
````

SharpGL for WinForms includes the Core as well as OpenGL controls to drop into your WinForms app.

````
PM> Install-Package SharpGLforWPF
````

SharpGL for WPF includes the Core as well as OpenGL controls to drop into your WPF app.

You can also get the binaries by going to the [Releases](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpgl/releases) page of this site.

Building the Code
-----------------

To build the code, clone the repo and open the SharpGL, Samples or Tools solution. All solutions are ready to go and require no additional components.

Sample Applications
-------------------

There are a large number of sample applications that show how to use SharpGL. Check out the 'Samples' solution to see the samples that are available - they'll be documented soon.

Documentation
-------------

It's finally a work in progress.
